        <lightning-accordion-section name="Question1" label="Why can’t I submit another claim?">
          <p class="faq-answer">

          <p class="faq-answer">
            <strong>Answer:</strong> If your claim is denied, you will see a 
            <i><b>“Start New Appeal”</b></i> button on your <i><b>Claims Page</b></i>.
